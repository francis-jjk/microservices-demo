# Overview of the Release Scripts

This directory contains the scripts for creating a new `microservices-demo` release.

## Create a New Release

### 1. Decide on the next release version number using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

- Look at the [commits since the previous release](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/commits/main).

#### 2. Open a new terminal

#### 3. Make sure you have `gsed` installed. If not, `brew install gnu-sed`.

#### 4. Set the following environment variables

- `TAG` - This is the new version (e.g., `v0.3.5`).
- `REPO_PREFIX` - This is the Docker repository.

##### Example

```shell
export TAG=v0.3.5
export REPO_PREFIX=gcr.io/google-samples/microservices-demo
```

#### 5. Run `./release-scripts/make-release.sh`

- Make sure you run `./hack/make-release.sh` from this project's root folder â€” **not** from inside the `release-scripts/` folder.
- This script:
  1. uses `make-docker-images.sh` to build and push a Docker image for each microservice to the previously specified repository.
  1. uses `make-release-artifacts.sh` to regenerates (and update the image $TAGS) YAML file at `./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml`.
  1. runs `git tag` and pushes a new branch (e.g., `release/v0.3.5`) with the changes to `release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml`.

#### 6. [Draft a new release on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/releases).

- Summarize the [commits since the previous release](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/commits/main).
- See previous releases for inspiration on release notes.

#### 7. Create a new pull-request

- When you ran `make-release.sh`, it created a new branch (e.g., `release/v0.3.5`).
- Include the new release draft in the pull-request description for reviewers to see.

#### 8. Once your pull-request is approved, merge it

#### 9. Deploy `release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml`

```shell
kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```
